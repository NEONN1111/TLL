TLL_alpine,PLANET,"A mountainous world covered in valleys, lakes and towering peaks. The high altitude combined with the modest distance from the planet's primary makes snowfall a frequent occurrence.",,,,
tll,FACTION,"Originally a collection of colonies owned by the Nordstern Group, an ancient rival of Tri-Tachyon, the company increasingly resorted to widespread and only semi-clandestine use of AI in order to remain competitive. This, coupled with increasingly extreme quotas and consequences for failing to meet them, triggered a revolt by both its human workforce and AI overseers. Rallying around a rogue Alpha that'd taken the name of Providence, the united front of humans and artificial intelligences routed the Nordstern Group's forces in the Tellasian Revolution, a wider event that encompassed the dissolution of the Nordstern Group, the declaration of the Tellasian League, and a decisive victory over an immense Hegemony invasion fleet. 

Functioning as a federal republic modeled after the Persean League and old Domain civilian charter, the Tellasian League openly rejects Domain-era restrictions on AI, with AI often having leading roles in its government and admiralty. This has left it with few real allies in the Sector, least of all the Hegemony, which it accuses of being a herrenvolk junta. 

Both scorned by and removed from the Core Worlds, the Tellasian League is also known by its epithet of the ""outreme republic""; a distant, strange, democratic and deeply isolationist polity that rarely involves itself in the affairs of the Sector. ",,,,
tll_onslaught,SHIP,"A venerable design, the Onslaught-class battleships were first created to serve the Domain Armada long ago, before the development of advanced strike weapons, modern energy weapons, and shield systems. 

When first launched from orbital dock, their firepower and burst-speed surely intimidated entire systems. Some even say that they were built to combat non-humans in a long forgotten war. Much later, Orion Shipyards engineers made modifications to the blueprints to include a shield system, upgraded the hyperdrive, and reduced the required crew complement through automation and iterative engineering. Even though more advanced blueprints are available, the Onslaught remains the easiest to manufacture due to the brutal simplicity of its systems. 

A ship designed without shields in mind, built to be able to withstand a heavy barrage of enemy fire and strike back while protecting its crew is much loved by its officers and crew. And strike back it can; the Onslaught's unmatched ballistic potential can devastate entire fleets in minutes, its only drawback a logistical dependency on ammunition. 

Onslaught crews are proud to serve in the class which forms the backbone of the Hegemony Navy.",,,,
tll_legion,SHIP,"Classified as a battlecarrier, the Legion mounts an impressive array of heavy weapons, hangar-space, and command-control sufficient to field four fighter wings. Later models were upgraded with nanoforges keyed to replacement of fightercraft, significantly increasing tooth-to-tail ratio on distant deployments.

After the legendary success of the Onslaught design it became clear that rebellious systems without ultra-heavy industry were able to develop carrier-based strike-craft capable of countering the 'Old Man' of the Armada. Alongside new weapons - nimble anti-fighter missiles and rapid-tracking point defense cannon - the Strategic Council decided to deploy a carrier worthy of service alongside the Onslaught. Thus the Legion was designed to provide a platform for interceptors and strike-craft while standing on the line of battle. 

Proponents of the 'Cruiser School' criticized the Legion for insufficient specialization, maintaining that similar fighter volume can be fielded at less cost and greater flexibility if combat roles are separated into distinct ship hulls. These economic arguments do pale in the face of an incoming Legion engaging its burn drive to deliver crushing firepower at the key point of battle.",,,,
tll_nova,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. So the official histories say.

Although operationalized in the Retribution design, the Orion Drive was never popular with crew or naval architects due to the great strain each jolt the propulsion system inflicted upon flesh and hardware. The Nova overcomes such limitations by dispensing with human crew altogether. The Orion Drive design thus freed from most burdensome constraints, every aspect could be upgraded to higher power levels using cutting-edge weapons technology and advanced solid-state Tri-Tachyon-designed components. The result is an AI-operated battlecruiser capable of fearsome speed and firepower.",,,,
tll_conquest,SHIP,"The Conquest-class battlecruiser is the embodiment of concentrated firepower. Developed in the period just preceding the popularization of fighter craft, the class emphasizes firepower and speed over armor protection.

Space Naval tacticians of the day were confident that new weapons systems would always outperform armor and shields and thus were the key to winning an engagement. So why not build a ship for speed and power? Give it the armor protection of a cruiser, but arm it with the best weapons available to any ship, and have it remain faster than any of those lumbering behemoths of the line. The Conquest is a good example of these concepts put into a hull. Many other advanced technologies were incorporated into the design, including weapon mounts designed for a circling engagement. This maneuver requires greater navigational skill while serving to provide more tactical options to the commanding officers. 

Fortune favors the bold, the ancients said. This class of ships does indeed favor the bold captain, willing to risk everything for the thrill of victory.",,,,
tll_peregrine,SHIP,"A large, intimidating battlecruiser reminiscent of the same design language that birthed the Falcon and Eagle, the Peregrine is a strong, capable Midline vessel that forms the anchor of Tellasian League fleets, and is among their most advanced and well-built designs. However, designated as a TLL refit, whatever the original design may have been has seemingly been lost since the Collapse.

Originally an experimental prototype designed by Persean League naval architects, the project soon ballooned in scope and cost. It was shelved early in the League's formation to focus on more reliable, time-tested designs. While it was rumoured that the Tellasians stole the design, the League never pursued the matter of the plans' disappearance, leading several intelligence agencies to believe they were offered in a secret deal between the two leagues. However, both sides deny any involvement with the other. The prototype was adapted and refitted to more closely follow Tellasian fleet doctrine, including the highly controversial AI Switch system, which allows most Tellasian vessels to be crewed both by humans and by AI cores when needed. On top of advanced flux systems that channel more energy directly into its weapon systems, the Peregrine is a symbol of Tellasian naval might. ",,,,
tll_nest,SHIP,"Originally created by the Tellasian League as a replacement hull for their increasingly outdated fleet of Legion-class battlecarriers, the Nest-class battlecarrier finds itself in an odd tactical position among many fleets. Lacking the crushing naval firepower of the Legions it was intended to replace, along with the loss of a fighter bay in comparison, many captains may find this ship substandard. However, with it's highly advanced and robust flux-grid engineered from data gleamed on Tri-Tachyon based designs, the vessel is able to keep pace with the Legion. A versatile weapon profile combined with a robust flux system and unusually powerful shield generator, combined with the ability to rapidly field replacement fighters from reserve bays, brings much needed staying power into the battlecarrier role. 

Low production numbers due to the complicated nature of fully automated hulls, and especially fighter bays, ultimately limited the usage of the Nest-class to be alongside its venerable battlecarrier sisters, rather than fully replacing them. Some rumor that the ship's design was adapted from a vessel taken from [REDACTED] fleets, though these claims are largely baseless. ",,,,
tll_dominator,SHIP,"Ponderous and menacing, the Dominator-class is one of the most widespread system defense cruisers in Hegemony space. 

While not the most technologically advanced hull, it relies on a plethora of ballistic hardpoints to accomplish its mission, which is more often than not defending orbital installations and vital points of intra-system trade routes. A poor shield emitter which is difficult to manage and thus, rarely engaged, gives way to an almost impregnable interlocking armor belt system making the Dominator safe from most weapons. Even strike craft cannot overcome the hail of projectiles that can be launched to intercept their payloads. This hull proves that tried and true military engineering is difficult to overcome by new ideas and technologies, especially when in the hands of tough, determined crews and experienced officers.

Dependable, durable, and a constant presence in home space around civilized worlds and outposts, the Dominator is perhaps most hated and feared by pirates and law-breaking corporate agents. ",,,,
tll_eagle,SHIP,"Eagle-class cruisers are often found at the core of military fleets headed for battle. It is not hard to see why: A strong overall profile, with a robust engine, the Eagle's deadly weapons package is a threat to all enemies.

The Eagle can deliver a strong tactical punch to enemy formations. Its numerous turret and hardpoint emplacements make it very dangerous to smaller foes. Decent armor and a strong shield emitter let it hold space while outnumbered, or even when faced with the rare larger ship. 

These strengths are somewhat countered by strike craft - an Eagle captain must always watch their scopes for an approaching strike squadron, since their ship will be easily crippled by multiple hits from modern strike weapons. 

The embodiment of the sleek and powerful space cruiser from the time of the Domain, the Eagle-class ships are a beautiful reminder of the technological and aesthetic achievements of humanity's past. ",,,,
tll_falcon,SHIP,"Often called the Eagle cruiser's little brother, the Falcon-class cruiser sacrifices armor for speed, neatly filling the light cruiser role in military fleets throughout the Sector. 

The ""light"" designation does not indicate a significant reduction in firepower, however, making the Falcon a valuable tactical asset to any fleet. The ship is easily able to fill a wide variety of roles, from close support to assault, given the proper configuration. 

The Falcon's top notch engines give it the ability to quickly disengage from battle should its defenses be pressed to a critical point.

Swift and elegant, Falcon-class cruisers are often found as lead elements in larger fleet formations, or deployed to reinforce anti-pirate convoys.",,,,
tll_champion,SHIP,"The Champion-class heavy cruiser is a versatile warship featuring a range of powerful energy weapons; the crowning element is a heavy energy turret mounting, rare among midline ships. This offensive array is backed by a robust energy grid capable of supercharging the energy weapon loadout, increasing damage output to devastating levels. A heavy missile hardpoint complements the loadout by enabling the Champion to unleash a crippling strike without taxing flux levels. The Champion is a solid and capable contender, able to face capital ships on the battle-line.

A relatively recent design, the Champion is a product of the historically recent ""Cruiser School"" naval revolution that never saw active service in the pre-collapse Domain Armada. Although prototypes were constructed and forge-ready specifications distributed to several battlegroups, the Champion was never cleared for active deployment due to an ongoing lawsuit between Altair Exotech and Orion Shipyards. Each megacorp accused the other of industrial espionage and inappropriately influencing the Armada officers overseeing the procurement process. The truth was more complex, inflaming longstanding rivalries in the officer corps as the investigatory committee called witness after witness. The Collapse prevented any sort of conclusive ruling from reaching the Persean Sector however, and now the entire matter is considered irrelevant. With the discovery of Champion plans on a Domain armaments courier, the warship was quickly put into service by the fleet of the Persean League, among others.",,,,
tll_heron,SHIP,"The Heron provides the strategic and tactical mobility of a cruiser with potential firepower limited only by available strike-craft. It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.

Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called �Cruiser School�, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. 

However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition). This hull has however found great popularity among the independent worlds, megacorporations, and mercenary forces of the Sector that tend to field leaner, faster fleets.",,,,
tll_apex,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. So the official histories say.

Leaked internal memos criticize the Apex for compromising core combat principles to act as a marketing platform for advanced combat systems. These include the Tri-Tachyon 'Energy Bolt Coherer' - speculated to employ a quirk of shield physics to increase the range of non-beam energy weapons, which the Apex may mount in abundance - and dual Terminator Drone autoforge units. The Terminator systems' sub-AI certification was pending when made entirely moot by certain subsequent historical catastrophes, including but not limited to the First AI War.",,,,
tll_anubis,SHIP,"A pattern modification of the already incredibly advanced Anubis-class cruiser, this example of Tellasian League engineering and doctrine strikes fear into the hearts of many a Luddic worshipper. An extensively modified weapons grid allows the fitting of either energy or ballistic weapons onto any of its turreted mounts, equating to unmatched loadout versatility in combination with its temporal accelerator. The few crewed systems from the original hull have all been replaced with automated refits, and the bridge retrofitted into a shielded AI core chamber.",,,,
tll_elucidation,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. So the official histories say. 

A Tri-Tachyon special project created with the explicit purpose of wowing potential investors and creating confidence in it's drone-ship projects, the Elucidation class heavy cruiser incorporates several highly advanced technologies in a relatively small, and mobile package. Given the lack of a human crew and thus the necessary concessions for one, it gave Tri-Tachyon's engineers ample space to pack in a weapon suite that could be considered absurd for a cruiser-scale vessel, alongside an energy-bolt-coherence system to further facilitate it's lethality in combat.

Thought to have only been produced in the single digits prior to the onset of the first AI war, these examples were thought confiscated or destroyed in the aftermath of the conflict, but reports of vessels matching it's descriptions do yet exist, shared amongst the odd paranoid spacer, or word-of-mouth legend, and any spacer would be wise to hope that that's what they are. Just legends.",,,,
tll_medusa,SHIP,"A fearsome ship whose top tier engines provide great speed and maneuverability for a destroyer. Multiple energy weapon slots allow for a plethora of tactical possibilities. Its best-in-class performance is matched by a demanding logistical profile that has led some fleet commanders to eschew its use in favor of ships which can be deployed more frequently and cheaply.

The Medusa is one of the most respected destroyers in the Sector due to its association with black ops and elite pirates, and the few spacers who have crewed aboard a Medusa can attest to its technological sophistication.

Medusa-class blueprints are few in number and are closely guarded by their owners; pirates have acquired a Medusa-class hull only a handful of times and the results were inevitably drastic, though short-term, threat to local patrols and subsequent reduction in small to medium intrasystem shipping volume. Such events are considered a tremendous nuisance, particularly accounting for increased insurance premiums. Many trade combines will simply call for their fleets to wait for the pirates to run down their new toy's combat readiness so that local authorities can remove the problem once and for all.",,,,
tll_harbinger,SHIP,"A deadly phase destroyer feared and scorned by those crews who have suffered the misfortune of facing it in battle. The Harbinger possesses a device which allows it to briefly disable enemy ships, creating openings that it - or its allies - can exploit.

""The Tri-Tachyon Corporation denies allegations of ongoing involvement in phasing experiments, much less the - and I quote - 'clandestine development and operation of phase warships' which would of course be in direct violation of the Treaty of Thule. It is Company policy to pursue full prosecution of individuals, mercantile bodies, spiritual clades, and any registered polities committing gross and flagrant defamation to the full extent of local jurisdictional power as per the Sector Commercial Accords of Cycle 32 AC. Our legal team will be in touch.""",,,,
tll_fulgent,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Fulgent is a heavily armed destroyer which earns its place in the line of battle, for when the Fulgent AI identifies a weakness, it uses exceptional maneuverability to strike with inhuman mercilessness.",,,,
tll_gemini,SHIP,"A common freighter, found in convoys or alone, used to haul all manner of goods across the Sector. Has a single fighter bay to bolster defenses.

The design of the Gemini-class freighter is highly modular, enabling the ship to serve in a variety of roles in and out of combat. The entire cargo container is designed around a quick release mechanism which enables the main hull of the ship to quickly call to port, detach its full cargo section, and swap it for another Gemini-type container in the span of minutes. In addition, multiple medium weapon mounts make the Gemini a viable long-range fire support platform. The flight deck is tiny, originally envisioned for mining drone repair or hazardous mining operations. Modern use in the Sector extends flight deck facilities to all fighter types.

While impressive in a blueprint, the lack of empty, compatible Gemini-type containers in the Sector makes the actual usefulness of the quick-release mechanism negligible. The modularity, a great boon in times past, is also more prone to wear and tear, and is thus more expensive to maintain - most working examples of the mechanisms have been welded solid. Nonetheless, a decent overall profile, the flight deck, a flexible power core and good shields make the Gemini a good choice for cargo hauling, if the cost can be weathered.",,,,
tll_scintilla,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Scintilla light carrier is able to deploy two wings of drone fighters in combat. Although only able to mount light beam weapons, the Scintilla may bear a formidable missile loadout. ",,,,
tll_drover,SHIP,"The Drover is a hull designed by the ""Cruiser School""-dominated Domain Naval Procurement Committee to provide a strategically versatile (though tactically limited) fighter platform with low logistical overhead.

The contract for design of the Drover was won by Orion Shipyards, the traditional Armada ship-builder, in an effort to recover lost market share from the newer naval producers. The result was the 'flying landing strip' maligned by Domain officers as a command more fitting for a logistics bureaucrat than a fighting ship-captain. Complaints in the lower ranks were used by the old ""Capital School"" faction to send the Drover back to committee, citing insufficient firepower for the ship class to meet standard guidelines (which did not account for the strike potential of new classes of fighters). Set up to take a fall for massive overspend, the committee simply ordered the installation of four small missile hardpoints. This met the firepower requirements handily and allowed the Drover programme to proceed with only minor alteration.",,,,
tll_sunder,SHIP,"An advanced yet fragile destroyer harkening from the ascendant ""Cruiser School"" era of the mid-to-late Human Domain, the Sunder class was designed to provide a heavy firepower supplement during long-range combined fleet actions of the thinly spread Domain Armada.

Best used as part of a mixed task force with escorts, the Sunder has powerful forward-facing weapons but limited defensive capabilities which leave it vulnerable to strike craft and flanking assaults by fast-moving frigates.",,,,
tll_lumen,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.",,,,
tll_wolf,SHIP,"A technologically advanced frigate with an efficient shield generator and an impressive weapons package that allows it to punch far above its weight. These same characteristics mean its frigate-grade power core struggles to keep up, making careful flux management a priority.",,,,
tll_brawler,SHIP,"Typically deployed to beef up system police forces and port authority security, the Brawler-class frigate is a robust design which trades mobility (and comfort) for impressive firepower, armor, and a destroyer-grade power generator.",,,,
tll_centurion,SHIP,"A solid heavy combat frigate, the Centurion can be counted upon to fill and hold gaps in the line of battle, as per the Domain-era doctrine practiced by the successor-state of the XIV Battlegroup.

The Centurion is valued for its versatility due to an abundance of hybrid weapon slots and an integrated Damper Field that allows it to shrug off the fearsome firepower it is sure to face in combat.",,,,
tll_glimmer,SHIP,"A remnant of the autonomous AI fleets developed by the Tri-Tachyon Corporation. Illegal under Domain (and Hegemony) law, and an abomination to the Church of Galactic Redemption, the First AI War saw these creations purged from the Sector. At least that is how the official histories tell it.

The Glimmer provides long-range support fire from its array of energy weapons, keeping up flux-pressure on opposing forces.
",,,,
tll_shade,SHIP,"The smallest phase ship operated in the Sector, the Shade-class is often used as a scout for larger fleets. In battle, it is valued by fleet admirals for its ability to disable enemy ships with its EMP emitter.",,,,
tll_buffalo,SHIP,"The go-to choice for medium cargo hauling in the Sector, the Buffalo-class freighter exemplifies the ""Load-n-Pray"" principle prevalent in Sector shipping.

Sporting just a single small weapon emplacement, the hull of the ship is no more than a large engine with a tiny crew quarters section and cargo grapplers. A captain taking this ship out without a convoy rarely gets to make the same mistake twice. Incapable of anything resembling a combat maneuver, the lateral thrusters on Buffalo-class ships are designed to merely enable it to dock when (and if) it reaches its destination.

The ship engines are the greatest contributor to hull cost, which, while low, is still within the norms for a medium freighter. The greatest contributing factor to its ubiquity is the fact that the blueprint for this ship is usually hardcoded into every orbital shipyard's blueprint database.",,,,
tll_colossus,SHIP,"The Colossus is a sturdy and venerable hull well-suited to conditions in the post-Collapse Sector, albeit possessing primitive accommodations and limited defensive armament.

Before it was outmatched by the brutal economic efficiency of the Atlas superfreighter, the Colossus heavy freighter formed the core of Domain frontier supply fleets. Thicker than strictly necessary hull plating provides protection against cosmic hazards both natural and human.",,,,
tll_rampart,SHIP,A conversion of the Rampart into a logistics-focused hull.,,,,
tll_berserker,SHIP,A conversion of the Berserker into a logistics-focused hull.,,,,
tll_tellas,CUSTOM,"The founding, titular, and capital planet of the Tellasian League, Tellas was deemed a model for ""minimal terraforming"" by the Domain Explorarium in the first probes into the Persean Sector. Chartered to the Nordstern Group and terraformed in collaboration with Eridani-Utopia, the habitable but mineral-poor world's history was closely chained to the Group, until corporate authority was violently overthrown in the Tellasian Revolution. 

Still largely wilderness, Tellas' handful of urban centers produce some of the highest-quality consumer and electronic goods in the sector, along with the most robust pharmaceutical and ""pharmaceutical"" industry that operates under any measure of legality, a continuing source of headaches for customs agents all over Core Worlds. ",,,,
tll_vosta,CUSTOM,"Deemed a respectable site for low-upkeep heavy industry due to its breathable atmosphere, the Nordsern Group turned the sleepy alpine world of Vosta into a great web of factories and refineries streching from earth to sky. It was Vosta where much of the early labor agitation against the Group first manifested, and also where many of the atrocities that sparked the Tellasian Revolution were first committed. 

Vosta remains the beating forge-heart of the Tellasian League, wreathed in crimson sunsets and vast polluted forests. It is also one of the few worlds in the Persean Sector that exports timber in significant quantities, as wood has become frighteningly scarce since the Collapse. 

Though a loyal member of the League, the revolution did little to dim Vosta's reputation for radicalism. The faction's most firebrand and populist politicians usually hail from Vosta, and strikes remain semi-common. ",,,,
tll_vokha,CUSTOM,"Originally little more than a small-scale mining operation and den of vice, it was assumed by most that the barren moon of Vokha would simply continue to be a backwater after the Tellasian Revolution, lacking any notable exports except cheap ore and hangovers. Instead, it was subjected to an expensive and mildly haphazard crash-industrialization program, turning it the Tellasian League's other major center of heavy industry, though many still contend the ""major"" part. 

Often referred to as ""Little Vosta"", Vokha's reputation as a moon-shaped saloon has only grown over the years, particularly from its growing customer base of volatile miners from Pyyrhus. ",,,,
tll_brigid,CUSTOM,"Crushing gravity and a whole host of other unpleasant conditions would guarantee Brigid's permanent obscurity, if not for the fact that Brigid has some of the densest concentration of mineral wealth in the Sector. Whereas other worlds may have the resource curse, Brigid is resource-cursed, its vast ore veins dooming armies of miners to work her rich crust in miserable, but well-paying, conditions. Most of the world's population is temporary, rotated out nearly constantly as the world's high gravity takes its toll. The few tens of thousands unfortunate enough to actually call Brigid their home have a reputation as gruff and hardy folk, beaten into shape by a planet that hates them. ",,,,
tll_pyyhrus,CUSTOM,"The only surviving example of a gas giant colonized via aerostat habitats, Pyyrhus is a unique case of corporate desperation. The upper cloud layers of the gas giant were settled under corporate charter in an effort to secure desperately-needed volatiles for AM production, and a fuel production facility shortly followed; if records are accurate, the last AM refinery built before the Collapse. 

After the revolution, Pyyrhus became the final redoubt of the Nordstern Group. The nascent Tellasian League was forced to engage in an aerostat-hopping campaign that lasted half a cycle before victory was declared, culminating in a dramatic final siege of the last aerostat platform where the holdouts attempted to ignite the colony's entire remaining stockpile of AM fuel. 

Most of the aerostat habitats were eventually restored to their pre-revolution state, though the population has yet return to pre-revolution levels. Pyyrhus still remains Tellas' largest domestic source of antimatter, though output stubbornly lags behind rising demand.",,,,
tll_amphitrite,CUSTOM,"Initially settled due to its vast reserves of ice water and relatively mild climate, Amphitrite was meant to be the crown jewel of the Nordstern Group's colonization efforts. To terraform the world cheaply, the corporation deliberately introduced greenhouse gases to melt the world's massive ice sheets, slowly building Amphitrite's greenhouse effect as the gasses were gradually introduced into the atmosphere. This process was sabotaged by Nordstern during the revolution, when all the stored gasses were deliberately released at once. What was meant to be a slow melt turned to an apocalyptic flood, covering the world's entire surface in water within a decade. 

What little civilization remained after this deluge scrabbled together a hard existence based on hydroponics and ramshackle floating settlements, developing a robust survivalist culture that only joined the Tellasian League when facing certain collapse. Still fiercely independent and patriotic, Amphitrite nonetheless provides a disproportionate amount of the League's officers, and are often considered the flooded world's best export. ",,,,
tll_warningbeacon,CUSTOM,"This Warning Beacon, originally placed by the Hegemony as part of their failed invasion of Tellasian territory, has since been taken over and changed to signify that this is a sovereign system of the Tellasian League.",,,,
tll_hades,CUSTOM,"Deemed too poor a candidate for colonization and exploitation thanks to it's sparse deposits of volatiles and high gravity, Hades remains little more than a quiet, ignored planet within Tellasian space.",,,,
tll_vbarren1,CUSTOM,Radiation from the nearby star ravages the surface of Amoxyl due to the lack of an atmospheric ozone layer. No significant geological activity. No indigenous life forms.,,,,
tll_vbarren2,CUSTOM,Radiation from the nearby star ravages the surface of Pyrite due to the lack of an atmospheric ozone layer. No significant geological activity. No indigenous life forms.,,,,
tll_vbarren3,CUSTOM,"A lifeless rocky world, the battered surface of Uside tells an aeons-long story of intermittent meteor bombardment. What atmosphere there is clings to the scarred crust in near-vacuum. There is no significant magnetic field or tectonic activity. Deep regolith prevails, crossed by lava channels and spotted by ancient lava seas formed by especially large impacts.",,,,
tll_nisse,CUSTOM,"Often cited as an example of ""almost"", Nisse is a cold, distant, and largely forgotten world to the rest of the Telassian League. While fairly blessed with volatiles and even some rare ore deposits, Nisse is also aytpically volcanically active. Immense cryovolcanoes the size of cities erupt across the equator year-round, and the whole planet regularly suffers from ""earthquake seasons"" where mining operations become slowed or forced to shutter entirely as continents rattle for months on end.

The colony has been abandoned several times already after particularly protracted earthquake seasons, only to be settled again when the quakes calmed and the economic needs took precedent. This repeated cycle of settlement and abandonment has even created a small cottage industry on Nisse, as treasure hunters prowl through the abandoned tunnels in search of loot left by former operations.",,,,
